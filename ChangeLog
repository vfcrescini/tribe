	* lib/network.c :

	  - More cleanup of tbe_net_add_rel(). Now we only check for the
	    intersection once.

	  - Cleanup so we dont have to purge the queue everytime we see an
	    error condition in tbe_net_add_rel().

	  - A little bit of cleanup. no point having 2 for loops in
	    tbe_net_add_rel().
