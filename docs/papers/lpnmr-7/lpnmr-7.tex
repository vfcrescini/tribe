  \begin{abstract}
    In this paper, we propose an access control system, \emph{Policy Updater},
    that provides policy evaluation as well as dynamic policy manipulation.
    This is achieved by the use of the proposed logic-based language L to
    represent the access control policies. As the language L is logic-based,
    policy manipulation is achieved by adding or removing atoms and constraints
    that make up the policy base. The policy base can then be translated into a
    normal logic program and then by using the \emph{Stable Models} semantics,
    authorization queries can be evaluated.
