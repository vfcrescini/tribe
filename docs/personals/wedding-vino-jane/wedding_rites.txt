Liturgy of the Word

  First Reading (Genesis 2:18-24)

    Reader 1:

      A reading from the book of Genesis

      (God took a bone from man's side, close to his heart, to show the tender
      love man and woman can share together).

      The Lord God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone. I will
      make him a helpmate". So from the soil the Lord God fashioned all the
      wild beasts and all the birds of heaven. These he brought to the man to
      see what he would call them; each one was to bear the name the man would
      give it. The man gave names to all the cattle, all the birds of heaven
      and all the wild beasts. But no helpmate suitable for man was found for
      him. So the Lord God mate the man fall into a deep sleep. And while he
      slept, he took one of his ribs and enclosed it in flesh. The Lord God
      built the rib he had taken from the man into a woman, and brought her to
      the man. The man exclaimed:

        "This at last is bone from my bones,
        and flesh from my flesh!
        This is to be called woman,
        for this was taken from man".

      This is why a man leaves his father and mother and joins himself to his
      wife, and they become one body.

      This is the word of the Lord.

    All:

      Thanks be to God.

  Responsorial Psalm (Psalms 148:1-4, 9-14)

    Reader 2:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

    All:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

    Reader 2:

      Praise the Lord from the heavens,
      praise him in the heights.
      Praise him, all his angels,
      praise him, all his host.

    All:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

    Reader 2:

      Praise him, sun and moon,
      praise him, shining stars.
      Praise him, highest heavens,
      and the waters above the heavens.

    All:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

    Reader 2:

      All mountains and hills,
      all fruit trees and cedars,
      beasts, wild and tame,
      reptiles and birds on the wing.

    All:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

    Reader 2:

      All earth's kings and peoples,
      earth's princes and rules:
      young men and maidens,
      old men together with children.

    All:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

    Reader 2:

      Let them praise the name of the Lord
      for he alone is exalted.
      The splendour of his name
      reaches beyond heaven and earth.

    All:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

  Second Reading (Corinthians1 12:31 - 13:8)

    Reader 3:

      A reading from the first letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians

      (St. Paul speaks of the selfless way that describes a loving couple's
      relationship).
 
      Be ambitious for the higher gifts. And I am going to show you a way
      that is better than any of them.
 
      If I have all the eloquence of men or of angels, but speak without love,
      I am simply a gong booming or a cymbal clashing. If I have the gift of
      prophecy, understanding all the mysteries there are, and knowing
      everything, and if I have faith in all its fullness, to move mountains,
      but without love, then I am nothing at all. If I give away all that I
      possess, piece by piece, and if I even let them take my body to burn it,
      but am without love, it will do me no good whatever.
 
      Love is always patient and kind; it is never jealous; love is never
      boastful or conceited; it is never rude or selfish; it does not take
      offense, and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people's
      sins but delights in the truth; it is always ready to excuse, to trust,
      to hope, and to endure whatever comes.
 
      Love does not come to an end.
 
      This is the word of the Lord.

    All:

      Thanks be to God.

  Gospel Acclamation

    Alleluia, alleluia!
    Everyone who loves is born of God and knows him.

    Alleluia!
 
  Gospel (Mark 10:6-9)

    Priest:

      The Lord be with you.

    All:

      And also with you.

    Priest:

      A reading from the Holy Gospel according to Mark.

    All:

      Glory to you, O Lord.

    Priest:

      (You are bound so closely to each other in marriage that in some ways you
      are to be inseparable).

      Jesus said, "From the beginning of creation God made them male and
      female. This is why a man must leave father and mother, and the two
      become one body. They are no longer two, therefore, but one body. So
      then, what God has united, man must not divide".
 
      This is the Gospel of the Lord.

    All:

      Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.

  Homily

Liturgy of the Sacrament

  Introduction

    Priest:

      Vino and Jane, the promise you make to each other today is serious,
      because it will bind you together for life in a relationship so close and
      so intimate that it will profoundly influence your whole future. That
      future, with its hopes and disappointments, its successes and its
      failures, its pleasures and its pains, its joys and its sorrows, is
      hidden from your eyes. You know that these elements are mingled in every
      life and are to be expected in your own. And so, not knowing what is
      before you, but trusting in God's companionship, you take each other
      through the best and worst of what lies ahead, until death. Join your
      hands, and commit yourselves to each other forever.

  Giving of Consent

    Priest to Both:

      Are you here by your own free will to be forever bound to each other in
      Holy Matrimony?

    Groom:

      I am.

    Bride:

      I am.

    Priest to Both:

      Are you prepared to love and honour each other as man and wife for the
      rest of your lives?

    Priest to Both:

    Groom:

      I am.

    Bride:

      I am.

      Are you ready to lovingly accept children from God and raise them in
      accordance with the laws of God and His Church?

    Groom:

      I am.

    Bride:

      I am.

    Priest:

      Since it is your intention to enter Holy Matrimony, join your right hands
      and declare your consent before God and His Church.

      (groom takes hand of bride)

    Priest to Groom:

      Vino, do you take Jane to be your lawful wife in accordance with the
      rites of the Holy Catholic Church?

    Groom:

      I do.

    Priest to Groom:

      Do you give yourself to her freely, as her husband?

    Groom:

      I do.

    Priest to Groom:

      Do you promise to be true to her in good times and in bad, in sickness
      and in health, to love and honour her in all the days of your life?

    Groom:

      I do.

    Priest to Bride:

      Jane, do you take Vino to be your lawful husband in accordance with the
      rites of the Holy Catholic Church?

    Bride:

      I do.

    Priest to Bride:

      Do you give yourself to him freely, as his wife?

    Bride:

      I do.

    Priest to Bride:

      Do you promise to be true to him in good times and in bad, in sickness
      and in health, to love and honour him in all the days of your life?

    Bride:

      I do.

    Priest:

      You have declared your consent before God and His Church. May the Lord,
      in his goodness, strengthen your bond and fill you both with his
      blessings. What God has joined, man must not divide.

    All:

      Amen.

  Blessing of Rings

    Priest:

      Lord, bless these rings. Grant that those who wear them may always have
      a deep faith in each other. May they do your will and always live
      together in peace, good will and love.
 
      We ask this through Christ our Lord.
 
    All:

      Amen.

  Exchange of Rings

    Groom:

      Jane, take this ring as a symbol of my love and fidelity. In the name of
      the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

    Bride:

      Vino, take this ring as a symbol of my love and fidelity. In the name of
      the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

Prayers of the Faithful

  Priest:

    God, the Father, source of all life and love, willed that husband and wife
    should become one flesh in marriage. Let us pray to him in sincerity of
    heart on this joyous occasion.

    For Vino and Jane, that their love for each other may be patterned on
    Christ's love for his bride, the Church, let us pray to the Lord.

  All:

  Priest:

    For married people everywhere, that they will live in love and
    faithfulness, for better, for worse, in joy or in sorrow, all the days of
    their lives, let us pray to the Lord.

  All:

    Lord, hear our prayer.

  Priest:

    Father of life and love, in union with Mary, our Mother, who was a wedding
    guest at Cana, we make our requests in prayer, through Christ, our Lord.

  All:

    Amen.

Wedding Candle, Veil and Cord Ceremony

  Lighting of the Unity Candle

  Commentator:

    We now ask the candle sponsors to light the candles.

    The flames of the lighted candles symbolise the light of life which was
    given by God. After receiving the light, we must pass it on through the
    light of faith to dispel doubt; through the light of hope to sharpen the
    vision; and through the light of love to bring life to our path. Heavenly
    Father, may the love of Vino and Jane be a reflection of Your light.

  Veil Ceremony

  Commentator:

    We now ask the veil sponsors to offer the symbol of unity.

    At baptism, Vino and Jane were clothed with a white garment symbolising a
    new life of purity as Christians. Today, they are once again clothed with
    this fine garment as they together enter a new phase in God's master plan.
    Wear it unstained and let the light of the Holy Spirit shine forth through
    all your children and everyone whom the Lord's loving desire will bring
    into your life.

  Cord Ceremony

  Commentator:

    We now ask the cord sponsors to come forward and place the cord upon Vino
    and Jane as a symbol of togetherness.

    Heavenly Father, may the cord over Vino and Jane be a symbol for them, and
    us, of their inseperable unity. Let this cord symbolise the love of God
    which binds their hearts and souls together. Let nothing come in between
    and break them apart. May your love for each other grow stronger and help
    carry each other's yoke with trust, forebearance and understanding.

Liturgy of the Eucharist

  Offeratory Hymn

  Preparation of the Gifts

  Prayer over the Gifts

    Priest:

      Pray friends that our sacrifice may be acceptable to God, the almighty
      father.

    All:

      May the Lord accept this sacrifice at your hands, for the praise and
      glory of your name, for our good and the good of all his Church.

    Priest:

      Lord, hear our prayers and accept the gifts we offer for Vino and Jane.
      Today you have made them one in the sacrament of marriage. May the
      mystery of Christ's unselfish love, which we celebrate in this Eucharist,
      increase their love for you and for each other.

      We ask this through Christ, our Lord.

    All:

      Amen.

  Eucharistic Prayer

    Priest:

      The Lord be with you.

    All:

      And also with you.

    Priest:

      Lift up your hearts.

    All:

      We lift them up to the Lord.

    Priest:

      Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.

    All:

      It is right to give Him thanks and praise.

    Priest:

      Father, all powerful and ever living God, we do well always and
      everywhere to give You thanks through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

      Through him you entered into a new covenant with your people. You
      restored man to grace in the saving mystery of redemption. You gave him a
      share in the divine life through his union with Christ. You made him an
      heir of Christ's eternal glory.

      This outpouring of love in the new covenant of grace is symbolised in
      the marriage covenant that seals the love of husband and wife, and
      reflects your divine plan of love.

      And so, with the angels and all the saints in heaven, we proclaim your 
      glory and join in their unending hymn of praise.

    Priest:

      Lord, You are hold indeed, the fountain of all holiness. Let your spirit
      come upon these gifts to make them holy, so that they may become for us
      the body and blood of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

      Before He was given up to death, a death He free accepted, He took bread
      and gave You thanks. He broke the bread, gave it to His disciples and
      said:

        "Take this, all of you, and eat it. This is my body which will be given
        up for you".

      When supper was ended, He took the cup. Again, He gave You thanks and
      praise, gave the cup to His disciples and said:

        "Take this, all of you, and drink from it. This is the cup of my blood,
        the blood of the new and everlasting covenant. It will be shared for
        you and for all men so that sins may be forgiven. Do this in memory
        of me".

      Let us proclaim the mysteries of faith.

  Acclamation

    Priest:

      In memory if His death and resurrection, we offer You, Father, this life-
      giving bread, this saving cup. We thank You for counting us worthy to
      stand in your presence and serve You. May all of us who share in the body
      and blood of Christ be brought together in unity by the Holy Spirit.
      Lord, remember Your church throughout the world. Make us grow in love
      together with Benedict XVI our Pope, Kevin our Archbishop, and all the
      clergy. Remember our brothers and sisters who have gone to their rest in
      the hope of rising again. Bring them and all the departed into the light
      of your presence. Have mercy on us all. Make us worthy to share eternal
      life with Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, with the apostles and all the
      saints who have done Your will thought all ages.

      May we praise You in union with them, and give Your glory through Your
      Son, Jesus Christ.

      Through Him, with Him, in Him. In the unity of the Holy Spirit, all glory
      and honour is Yours, Almighty Father, forever and ever.

  Lord's Prayer

    Priest:

      Let us pray in confidence to the Father, in the words our Saviour gave
      us.

    All:

      Our Father, who art in heaven,
      hallowed by thy name.
      Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
      on earth, as it is in heaven.
      Give us this day our daily bread,
      and forgive us our trespasses,
      as we forgive those who trespass against us.
      And lead us not into temptation,
      but deliver us from evil.

    Priest:

      Deliver us Lord, from every evil and grant us peace in our day. In your
      mercy, you keep us free from sin and protect us from all anxiety, as we
      wait in joyful hope for the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.

    All:

      For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever.

  Nuptial Blessing

    Priest:

      My dear friends let us ask God for his continued blessings upon this
      bridegroom and his bride.

      Holy Father,
      creator of the universe,
      maker of man and woman in your own likeness,
      source of blessing for married life,
      we humbly pray to you for this woman
      who today is united with her husband in this sacrament of marriage.

      May your fullest blessing come upon her and her husband,
      so that they may together rejoice in your gift of married love,
      and enrich your Church with their children.

      Lord, may they both praise you when they are happy
      and turn to you in their sorrows.
      May they be glad that you help them in their work
      and know that you are with them in their need.
      May they pray to you in the community of the Church,
      and be your witness in the world.
      May they reach old age in the company of their friends,
      and come at last to the kingdom of heaven.

      We ask this through Christ, our Lord.

      Amen.
