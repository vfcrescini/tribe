Liturgy of the Word

  First Reading (Genesis 2:18-24)

    Reader 1:

      A reading from the book of Genesis

      (God took a bone from man's side, close to his heart, to show the tender
      love man and woman can share together).

      The Lord God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone. I will
      make him a helpmate". So from the soil the Lord God fashioned all the
      wild beasts and all the birds of heaven. These he brought to the man to
      see what he would call them; each one was to bear the name the man would
      give it. The man gave names to all the cattle, all the birds of heaven
      and all the wild beasts. But no helpmate suitable for man was found for
      him. So the Lord God mate the man fall into a deep sleep. And while he
      slept, he took one of his ribs and enclosed it in flesh. The Lord God
      built the rib he had taken from the man into a woman, and brought her to
      the man. The man exclaimed:

        "This at last is bone from my bones,
        and flesh from my flesh!
        This is to be called woman,
        for this was taken from man".

      This is why a man leaves his father and mother and joins himself to his
      wife, and they become one body.

      This is the word of the Lord.

    All:

      Thanks be to God.

  Responsorial Psalm (Psalms 148:1-4, 9-14)

    Reader 2:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

    All:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

    Reader 2:

      Praise the Lord from the heavens,
      praise him in the heights.
      Praise him, all his angels,
      praise him, all his host.

    All:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

    Reader 2:

      Praise him, sun and moon,
      praise him, shining stars.
      Praise him, highest heavens,
      and the waters above the heavens.

    All:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

    Reader 2:

      All mountains and hills,
      all fruit trees and cedars,
      beasts, wild and tame,
      reptiles and birds on the wing.

    All:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

    Reader 2:

      All earth's kings and peoples,
      earth's princes and rules:
      young men and maidens,
      old men together with children.

    All:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

    Reader 2:

      Let them praise the name of the Lord
      for he alone is exalted.
      The splendour of his name
      reaches beyond heaven and earth.

    All:

      Let all praise the name of the Lord.

  Second Reading (Corinthians1 12:31 - 13:8)

    Reader 3:

      A reading from the first letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians

      (St. Paul speaks of the selfless way that describes a loving couple's
      relationship).
 
      Be ambitious for the higher gifts. And I am going to show you a way
      that is better than any of them.
 
      If I have all the eloquence of men or of angels, but speak without love,
      I am simply a gong booming or a cymbal clashing. If I have the gift of
      prophecy, understanding all the mysteries there are, and knowing
      everything, and if I have faith in all its fullness, to move mountains,
      but without love, then I am nothing at all. If I give away all that I
      possess, piece by piece, and if I even let them take my body to burn it,
      but am without love, it will do me no good whatever.
 
      Love is always patient and kind; it is never jealous; love is never
      boastful or conceited; it is never rude or selfish; it does not take
      offense, and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people's
      sins but delights in the truth; it is always ready to excuse, to trust,
      to hope, and to endure whatever comes.
 
      Love does not come to an end.
 
      This is the word of the Lord.

    All:

      Thanks be to God.

  Gospel Acclamation

    Alleluia, alleluia!
    Everyone who loves is born of God and knows him.

    Alleluia!
 
  Gospel (Mark 10:6-9)

    Priest:

      The Lord be with you.

    All:

      And also with you.

    Priest:

      A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark.

    All:

      Glory to you O Lord.

    Priest:

      (You are bound so closely to each other in marriage that in some ways you
      are to be inseparable).

      Jesus said, "From the beginning of creation God made them male and
      female. This is why a man must leave father and mother, and the two
      become one body. They are no longer two, therefore, but one body. So
      then, what God has united, man must not divide".
 
      This is the Gospel of the Lord.

    All:

      Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.

  Introduction

    (parents & sponsors step forward)

    Priest:

      Vino and Jane, the promise you make to each other today is serious,
      because it will bind you together for life in a relationship so close and
      so intimate that it will profoundly influence your whole future. That
      future, with its hopes and disappointments, its successes and its
      failures, its pleasures and its pains, its joys and its sorrows, is
      hidden from your eyes. You know that these elements are mingled in every
      life and are to be expected in your own. And so, not knowing what is
      before you, but trusting in God's companionship, you take each other
      through the best and worst of what lies ahead, until death. Join your
      hands, and commit yourselves to each other forever.

      accordance with the laws of God and His Church?

    Groom:

      I am.

    Bride:

      I am.

    Priest:

      Since it is your intention to enter Holy Matrimony, join your right hands
      and declare your consent before God and His Church.

      (groom takes hand of bride)

      and in health, to love and honour him in all the days of your life?

      I do.

    Priest:

      You have declared your consent before God and His Church. May the Lord,

    Priest:

      Let us give thanks to the Lord our God.

    All:

      It is right to give Him thanks and praise.

    Priest:

      Father, all powerful and ever living God, we do well always and
      everywhere to give You thanks through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

      Through him you entered into a new covenant with your people.
      You restored man to grace in the saving mystery of redemption.
      You gave him a share in the divine life through his union with Christ.
      You made him an heir of Christ's eternal glory.

      This outpouring of love in the new covenant of grace is symbolised in
      the marriage covenant that seals the love of husband and wife, and
      reflects your divine plan of love.

      And so, with the angels and all the saints in heaven,
      we proclaim your glory and join in their unending hymn of praise.

      (song)

      Lord, You are hold indeed, the fountain of all holiness. Let your spirit
      come upon these gifts to make them holy, so that they may become for us
      the body and blood of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

      Before He was given up to death, a death He free accepted, He took bread
      and gave You thanks. He broke the bread, gave it to His disciples and
      said:

        "Take this, all of you, and eat it. This is my body which will be given
        up for you".

      When supper was ended, He took the cup. Again, He gave You thanks and
      praise, gave the cup to His disciples and said:

        "Take this, all of you, and drink from it. This is the cup of my blood,
        the blood of the new and everlasting covenant. It will be shared for
        you and for all men so that sins may be forgiven. Do this in memory
        of me".

      Let us proclaim the mysteries of faith.

    (acclamation song)

    Priest:

      In memory if His death and resurrection, we offer You, Father, this life-
      giving bread, this saving cup. We thank You for counting us worthy to
      stand in your presence and serve You. May all of us who share in the body
      and blood of Christ be brought together in unity by the Holy Spirit.

      together with John Paul II our Pope, Kevin our archbishop, and all the
      clergy. Remember our brothers and sisters who have gone to their rest in
      the hope of rising again. Bring them and all the departed into the light
