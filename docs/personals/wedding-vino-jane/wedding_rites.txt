    Father,

    who today are united in marriage before your altar.
    Give them your blessing,

Liturgy of the Word

  First Reading

    A reading from the book of Tobit (8:4-8)
 
    (Marriage calls for a deep sharing of selves. Couples are called to
    share their joys and tears, their prayer as well. To pray, as Tobias and
    Sarah knew, is to place your lives in the Father's hands).
 
    On the evening of their marriage, Tobias said to Sarah, "You and I must
    pray and petition our Lord to win his grace and protection". They began
    praying for protection, and this was how he began:
 
    You are blessed, O God of our fathers;
    blessed, too, is your name
    for ever and ever.
    Let the heavens bless you
    and all things you have made
    for evermore.
    It was you who created Adam,
    you who created Eve his wife
    to be his help and support;
    and from these two the human race was born.
    It was you who said,
    "It is not good that the man should be alone;
    let us make him a helpmate like himself".
    and  so I do not take my sister
    for any lustful motive;
    I do it in singleness of heart.
    Be kind enough to have pity on her and on me
    and bring us to old age together.
 
    And together they said, "Amen, Amen".
 
    This is the word of the Lord.

  Responsorial Psalm (Ps 102:1-2. 8. 13. 17-18, R v. 8)

    The Lord is kind and merciful.
 
    My soul, give thanks to the Lord,
    all my being, bless his holy name.
    My soul, give thanks to the Lord
    and never forget all his blessings.

    The Lord is kind and merciful.
 
    The Lord is compassion and love,
    slow to anger and rich in mercy.
    As a father has compassion on his sons,
    the Lord has pity on those who fear him.

    The Lord is kind and merciful.
 
    The love of the Lord is everlasting
    upon those who hold him in fear;
    his justice reaches out to children's children
    When they keep his covenant in truth.

    The Lord is kind and merciful.

  Second Reading (12:31 - 13:8)

    A reading from the first letter of St. Paul to the Corinthians

    (St. Paul speaks of the selfless way that describes a loving couple's
    relationship).
 
    Be ambitious for the higher gifts. And I am going to show you a way that is
    better than any of them.
 
    If I have all the eloquence of men or of angels, but speak without love, I
    am simply a gong booming or a cymbal clashing. If I have the gift of
    prophecy, understanding all the mysteries there are, and knowing
    everything, and if I have faith in all its fullness, to move mountains, but
    without love, then I am nothing at all. If I give away all that I possess,
    piece by piece, and if I even let them take my body to burn it, but am
    without love, it will do me no good whatever.
 
    Love is always patient and kind; it is never jealous; love is never
    boastful or conceited; it is never rude or selfish; it does not take
    offence, and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people's
    sins but delights in the truth; it is always ready to excuse, to trust, to
    hope, and to endure whatever comes.
 
    Love does not come to an end.
 
    This is the word of the Lord.

  Gospel Acclamation

    Alleluia, alleluia!
    Everyone who loves is born of God and knows him.
    Alleluia!
 
  Gospel

    A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark (10:6-9)

    (You are bound so closely to each other in marriage that in some ways you
    are to be inseparable).
 
    Jesus said, "From the beginning of creation God made them male and female.
    This is why a man must leave father and mother, and the two become one
    body. They are no longer two, therefore, but one body. So then, what God
    has united, man must not divide".
 
    This is the Gospel of the Lord.

  Homily

Liturgy of the Sacrament

  Introduction

    Vino and Jane, the promise you make to each other today is serious, because
    it will bind you together for life in a relationship so close and so
    intimate that it will profoundly influence your whole future. That future,
    with its hopes and disappointments, its successes and its failures, its
    pleasures and its pains, its joys and its sorrows, is hidden from your
    eyes. You know that these elements are mingled in every life and are to be
    expected in your own. And so, not knowing what is before you, but trusting
    in God's companionship, you take each other through the best and worst of
    what lies ahead, until death. Join your hands, and commit yourselves to each
    other forever.

  Giving of Consent

    Priest asks the bridegroom:

    Vino, do you take Jane to be your wife? Do you promise to be true to her in
    good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, to love her and honour
    her all the days of your life?

    Bridegroom:

    I do.

    Priest to the Bride:

    Jane, do you take Vino to be your husband? Do you promise to be true to him
    in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, to love him and honour
    him all the days of your life?

    Bride:

    I do.

  Blessing of Rings

    Lord, bless these rings which we bless in your name.
    Grant that those who wear them
    May always have a deep faith in each other.
    May they do your will
    And always live together
    In peace, good will, and love.
 
    We ask this through Christ our Lord.
 
    Amen.

  Exchange of Rings

    Bridegroom:

    Jane, take this ring as a symbol of my love and fidelity. In the name of
    the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

    Bride:

    Vino, take this ring as a symbol of my love and fidelity. In the name of
    the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
