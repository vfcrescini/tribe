	* lib/Makefile.in :

	  - Compile mem.h and mem.c

	* lib/list.c :
	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/tribe.h :

	  - Renamed the memory macros TBE_PTR_* to TBE_MEM_*.

	* lib/mem.h :
	* lib/mem.c :

	  - When enabled (through --enable-debug), the wrapper functions
	    for malloc, realloc and free will dump the memory address
	    involved in the operation. A very crude way of detecting
	    memory leaks.

	* test/mem_test.sh :

	  - Added a simple script that checks for memory leaks based on the
	    output of the memory debug mechanism.

2005-07-20  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* VERSION :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Version 0.0.4.

	* lib/network.c :

	  - Casting to type void ** triggers a "dereferencing type-punned
	    pointer will break strict-aliasing rules" compiler warning. These
	    pointers are now cast to void * instead.

	* configure.ac :

	  - Added a new option --enable-testprog.

	* test/Makefile.in :

	  - Test program is now compiled when --enable-testprog is given
	    in configure, regardless of whether --enable-debug is given or
	    not.

	  - Renamed the test program to tribe_test.

2005-03-23  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/network.c :

	  - Some minor cleanup.

	* lib/list.c :

	  - Fixed bug that required initialisation of pointers to null before
	    use the list_get() functions.

2005-03-22  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :

	  - Added a normalise() function to ensure that a relation:

	      a rs b

	    will have a <= b.

	  - The enque() function now normalises the relation before it is
	    added in. Enqueue also checks whether the relation is already
	    in the queue.

	  - Added other cleanup functions.

2005-03-04  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/rel.c :
	* lib/rel.h :

	  - Changed order of relation macros.

	  - Simplified inverse().


	* VERSION :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Version 0.0.3.

2005-03-02  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/network.c :

	  - Added checks for skipping conditions (Van Beek's optimisation).

	  - More cleanup of tbe_net_add_rel(). Now we only check for the
	    intersection once.

	  - Cleanup so we dont have to purge the queue everytime we see an
	    error condition in tbe_net_add_rel().

	  - A little bit of cleanup. no point having 2 for loops in
	    tbe_net_add_rel().

2005-02-23  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* VERSION :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Version 0.0.2.

	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :

	  - Cleanup: removed rlist typedef from header file.

	  - Now uses an efficient queue instead of making recursive calls to
	    add().

	  - Fixed logic error in adding to queue / network (the second for
	    loop).

	* test/test.c :

	  - Added another node in test network.

	* lib/list.c :
	* lib/list.h :
	* lib/network.c :

	  - Added head and tail list operations (add, get, del) for
	    efficiency.

	* configure.ac :
	* test/Makefile.in :

	  - Added a LIBDIR variable to allow libtribe and its headers to be
	    the dependencies of the test program.

2005-02-22  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* test/Makefile.in :

	  - test only gets built if --enable-debug is specified in configure.

	* VERSION :

	  - Added VERSION file.

	* configure.ac :

	  - Removed CXX definitions carried over from vlad.

	* ChangeLog :

	  - Started change log.
