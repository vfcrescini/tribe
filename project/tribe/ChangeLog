	* VERSION :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Version 0.3.3.

	* test/Makefile.in :

	  - tribe_test is now dependent on clist.h.

	* test/test.c :

	  - Added a test for tbe_net_get_tuples().

	* lib/Makefile.in :

	  - Now network.o is dependent on clist.h.

	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :

	  - Added a call to clist_verify() in get_tuple() to ensure that all
	    the variables in the clist are valid.

	  - Added a get_tuple() function so that a set of interval variables
	    can be grounded with intervals that satisfy the given constraints.

	* lib/clist.h :
	* lib/clist.c :

	  - Removed the offset parameter. clist doesn't care about literals. It
	    only cares about variables and the tuple in validate().

	* test/test.c :

	  - Renamed all test intervals so that they start with 0.

2005-11-21  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/mem.c :

	  - Debug version of tbe_mem_realloc() will no longer print FREE if the
	    original pointer is null.

2005-11-19  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/Makefile.in :
	* lib/clist.c :
	* lib/clist.h :

	  - Added clist for grounding of interval variables.

2005-11-13  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/network.c :

	  - get_intervals() will now only consider externally defined
	    intervals.

2005-11-07  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :

	  - Added get_intervals() which generates a list of intervals whose
	    relation with a given interval is a subset of a given relset, then
	    calls a given function for every matching interval.

	* test/test.c :

	  - Added a test for the new get_interval() function.

2005-09-07  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* VERSION :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Version 0.3.2

2005-09-05  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* test/test.c :

	  - Addded some tests to check correct operation of the new get_rel()
	    function.

	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :

	  - Added a new get_rel() function to return the relations between an
	    existing interval and a pair of endpoints.

	  - Renamed existing get_rel() function to get_rel1() to make way for
	    the new one.

	  - Added an int_cnt field in the net structure to keep track of the
	    number of internal intervals created.

	* lib/interval.h :

	  - Added a macro for checking equality between two intervals.

	* lib/interval.h :
	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :
	* lib/rel.c ;
	* lib/rel.h :
	* lib/rlist.c :
	* lib/rlist.h :
	* lib/rqueue.c :
	* lib/rqueue.h :
	* test/test.c :

	  - Added a "type" parameter in interval. This is really an id, i.e.
	    "id" and "type" together uniquely identifies an interval. This
	    allows for internal intervals to be defined which is transparent
	    from the network interface.

2005-09-02  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/interval.h :

	  - Changed type of ep_mask from unsigned int to unsigned char.

	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :
	* lib/rel.c :
	* lib/rel.h :
	* lib/rqueue.c :
	* lib/rqueue.h :
	* test/test.c :

	  - Removed tbe_rel structure. Everything is back to using 2 ids and a
	    relset. Cleaner this way. It was a bloody stupid idea to have
	    tbe_rel.

	  - Moved the normalise() function to rqueue since it is the only
	    module that uses it.

2005-08-31  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :
	* lib/rel.c :
	* lib/rel.h :
	* lib/rlist.c :
	* lib/rlist.h :
	* lib/rqueue.c :
	* lib/rqueue.h :

	  - Cleanup. Mostly changing int_id's to simply id's.

2005-08-30  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :

	  - Redefined the tbe_net structure as void *. Internally, this is
	    defined as a structure. At the moment, it only contains a single
	    field -- the original list. In the future, additional fields will
	    be added.

2005-08-29  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/rlist.c :
	* lib/rlist.h :

	  - Parameter cleanup.

2005-08-29  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* VERSION :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Version 0.3.1

	* lib/rqueue.c :
	* lib/rqueue.h :
	* lib/iqueue.c :
	* lib/iqueue.h :

	  - Dequeue function now requires that all fields are given.

	  - Now relations are normalised before they are enqueued.

	  - The queue implementation now uses the tbe_rel structure, and
	    as a tbe_rel queue, is apropriately renamed to rqueue.

	* lib/network.c :

	  - Now uses rqueue.

	* lib/Makefile :

	  - Compile rqueue.c instead of iqueue.c.

	* lib/rel.c :
	* lib/rel.h :

	  - Added create(), destroy() and free() functions to support the
	    tbe_rel structure.

	  - Added an ISEQL macro.

2005-08-26  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/interval.h :

	  - Renamed macros for clarity.

	* lib/rel.c :
	* lib/rel.h :

	  - Cleanup of identifier names.

	  - Defined a new tbe_rel structure to encapsulate two interval id's
	    and a relset.

	  - Changed the interface of tbe_rel_normalise() to use the new
	    tbe_rel structure.

	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :

          - Changed the interface of the following functions to use the new
            tbe_rel structure:

            - tbe_net_add_rel_noprop()
            - tbe_net_add_rel()

	* test/test.c :

	  - Now uses the new interfaces and macros.

2005-08-25  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/interval.h :

	  - A new header file that contains an interval structure (endpoints
	    and mask) plus some useful macros.

	* lib/Makefile.in :

	  - Include interval.h.

	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :

	  - Renamed tbe_net_rel() to tbe_net_get_rel().

	  - Removed tbe_net_normalise(). This is really a relation thing, and
	    as such, should be in rel.c.

	  - Renamed interval identifiers to int_id.

	  - Used the new tbe_interval structure where two endpoints and a mask
	    were previously used.

	  - In tbe_net_add_ep(), there's no need to check the validity of
	    endpoints or to see if at least one endpoint is given. These checks
	    are done by tbe_rel_calc().

	  - Inte tbe_net_add_rel(), we have to make sure that the given relset
	    is not empty.

	  - Cleanup of tbe_net_normalise().

	  - Cleanup. Renamed tbe_net_propagate[12]() to
	    tbe_net_trav_prop[12]().

	  - Added tbe_net_add_ep() which allows endpoints of intervals to be
	    defined. The new function tbe_net_propagate2() goes through all the
	    intervals in the network whose endpoints are defined and works out
	    the relations between them.

	  - Renamed all previous propagate functions and structures to
	    propagate1 to avoid confusion with the new propagate functions and
	    structures.

	* lib/rel.c :
	* lib/rel.h :

	  - Added tbe_rel_normalise(), previously called tbe_net_normalise().

	  - Removed any interval-related macros (moved to interval.h).

	  - tbe_rel_calc() now uses the tbe_interval structure.

	  - Added TBE_REL_SET_ALL and TBE_REL_SET_NUL macros.

	* test/test.c :

	  - Now uses new tbe_rel_calc() and tbe_net_add_ep() interface.

	  - Added a test for tbe_net_add_ep().

	* test/Makefile.in :

	  - Add interval.h as dependency.

2005-08-23  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/rel.c :
	* lib/rel.h :

	  - Cleaned up the interface for tbe_rel_calc(). We now pass two masks
	    instead of one. More parameters, more memory, but clearer.

	  - Include stdio.h. Needed by references to the FILE structure.

	* test/test.c :

	  - Now uses new tbe_rel_calc() interface.

	* lib/rlist.h :

	  - Include stdio.h. Needed by references to the FILE structure.

2005-08-19  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/network.c :

	  - Clarified algorithms in the comments.

	  - Added a check to prevent propagating relations that is not
	    more specific than what is already known.

2005-08-16  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/iqueue.c :
	* lib/list.c :
	* lib/list.h :
	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/rlist.c :

	  - Added const qualifier in the parameters of *_cmp() functions.

	* lib/Makefile.in :
	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :
	* lib/rlist.c :
	* lib/rlist.h :

	  - Moved rlist implementation out of network.c and into their own
	    files.

	  - Some general cleanup.

2005-08-15  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* VERSION :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Version 0.3.0

	* lib/rel.c :
	* lib/rel.h :
	* test/test.c :

	  - tbe_rel_calc() now takes a bitmask to indicate which endpoins are
	    defined. This change allows time == 0 to be used as a time value.

2005-08-08  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/rel.c :

	  - tbe_rel_calc() now accepts partial endpoint information and
	    returns a relset. It should be noted *somewhere* that a zero time
	    value (an endpoint) indicates that the time value is not known.

	  - Fixed small error in calc().

	* test/test.c :

	  - Added test for tbe_rel_calc().

	* docs/rel.txt :

	  - Added interval relation definitions to avoid confusion.

2005-08-05  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/rel.c :
	* lib/rel.h :

	  - Added a function, tbe_rel_calc(), that will give the relation
	    that exists between two intervals, as defined by the given
	    endpoints.

2005-08-05  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* VERSION :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Version 0.2.0

	* lib/rel.c :
	* lib/rel.h :

	  - Minor macro correction: from TBE_STR_* to TBE_REL_STR_*.

2005-07-28  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/list.h :
	* lib/list.c :

	  - Added a traverse list function that will go through each node of a
	    given list and call a given function.

	* lib/network.c :

	  - Sacrificed readability for efficiency! The network dump functions
	    now use the traverse list function.

	  - Now add_rel() uses the traverse list function too.

	* test/mem_test.sh :

	  - Removed BASH extensions like arrays, $[], etc.

	  - Also show free'd pointers that were unmalloc'd.

2005-07-27  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/mem.h :
	* lib/mem.c :

	  - When enabled (through --enable-debug), the wrapper functions
	    for malloc, realloc and free will dump the memory address
	    involved in the operation. A very crude way of detecting
	    memory leaks.

	* lib/tribe.h :

	  - Removed old TBE_PTR_ macros in favour of the new TBE_MEM_ in
	    mem.h.

	* test/mem_test.sh :

	  - Added a simple script that checks for memory leaks based on the
	    output of the memory debug mechanism.

	* lib/list.h :
	* lib/list.c :

	  - Now uses new memory macros.

	  - Encapsulated the list internals into list.c. In the header file,
	    the list type definition is just void *.

	  - Interal structures renamed with a __tbe prefix.

	  - Added tbe_list_create() and tbe_list_destroy() to manually
	    allocate and deallocate a list.

	  - Added a generic tbe_list_free function to be used by lists with
	    standard nodes.

	* lib/network.h :
	* lib/network.c :

	  - tbe_net_rqueue removed (see iqueue entry below).

	  - Modified to use the new list interface, now has tbe_net_create()
	    and tbe_net_destroy().

	  - As with tbe_list, net structures are hidden in the .c file.

	  - Fixed some memory leaks found by our crude memory debugger.

	* lib/iqueue.h :
	* lib/iqueue.c :

	  - What was once rqueue in network.c is moved to iqueue.h/.c.

	* test/test.c :

	  - Modified to use new network.h interface.

	* lib/Makefile.in :

	  - Compile mem.h and mem.c

	  - Compile iqueue.h and iqueue.c

2005-07-20  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* VERSION :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Version 0.0.4.

	* lib/network.c :

	  - Casting to type void ** triggers a "dereferencing type-punned
	    pointer will break strict-aliasing rules" compiler warning. These
	    pointers are now cast to void * instead.

	* configure.ac :

	  - Added a new option --enable-testprog.

	* test/Makefile.in :

	  - Test program is now compiled when --enable-testprog is given
	    in configure, regardless of whether --enable-debug is given or
	    not.

	  - Renamed the test program to tribe_test.

2005-03-23  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/network.c :

	  - Some minor cleanup.

	* lib/list.c :

	  - Fixed bug that required initialisation of pointers to null before
	    use the list_get() functions.

2005-03-22  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :

	  - Added a normalise() function to ensure that a relation:

	      a rs b

	    will have a <= b.

	  - The enque() function now normalises the relation before it is
	    added in. Enqueue also checks whether the relation is already
	    in the queue.

	  - Added other cleanup functions.

2005-03-04  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/rel.c :
	* lib/rel.h :

	  - Changed order of relation macros.

	  - Simplified inverse().


	* VERSION :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Version 0.0.3.

2005-03-02  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* lib/network.c :

	  - Added checks for skipping conditions (Van Beek's optimisation).

	  - More cleanup of tbe_net_add_rel(). Now we only check for the
	    intersection once.

	  - Cleanup so we dont have to purge the queue everytime we see an
	    error condition in tbe_net_add_rel().

	  - A little bit of cleanup. no point having 2 for loops in
	    tbe_net_add_rel().

2005-02-23  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* VERSION :
	* configure.ac :

	  - Version 0.0.2.

	* lib/network.c :
	* lib/network.h :

	  - Cleanup: removed rlist typedef from header file.

	  - Now uses an efficient queue instead of making recursive calls to
	    add().

	  - Fixed logic error in adding to queue / network (the second for
	    loop).

	* test/test.c :

	  - Added another node in test network.

	* lib/list.c :
	* lib/list.h :
	* lib/network.c :

	  - Added head and tail list operations (add, get, del) for
	    efficiency.

	* configure.ac :
	* test/Makefile.in :

	  - Added a LIBDIR variable to allow libtribe and its headers to be
	    the dependencies of the test program.

2005-02-22  Vino Fernando Crescini  <jcrescin@cit.uws.edu.au>

	* test/Makefile.in :

	  - test only gets built if --enable-debug is specified in configure.

	* VERSION :

	  - Added VERSION file.

	* configure.ac :

	  - Removed CXX definitions carried over from vlad.

	* ChangeLog :

	  - Started change log.
