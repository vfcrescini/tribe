- Use per-server configuration. Currently, the configuration is per-directory
  because the core module insists that the auth directives (AuthName, AuthType,
  etc.) be configured on a per-directory basis.

- Support for aliased scripts (ScriptAlias directive) and directories (Alias
  directive). At the moment, authorization is granted or denied based on the
  physical locations of resources.

- Add support for transformation sequence manipulation.

- See if module is really thread-safe.
