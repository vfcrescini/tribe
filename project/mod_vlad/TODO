- Use per-server configuration. Currently, the configuration is per-directory
  because the core module insists that the auth directives (AuthName, AuthType,
  etc.) be configured on a per-directory basis.

- Support for aliased scripts (ScriptAlias directive) and directories (Alias
  directive). At the moment, authorization is granted or denied based on the
  physical locations of resources.

- Fix configuration so that data is shared between all threads. At the moment,
  a different vlad kb is kept for each thread.

- Locking mechanism to allow multiple admins to administer at the same time.
