EPILOG Build/Use Instructions

1. From the toplevel source directory, run make :

     $ make

   For a debug build (lots of output, compiled with -g) :

     $ make DEBUG=1

2. The executable binary will be in main/epilog. At the moment,
   the program will read all input from stdin, dump all debug
   info (also errors/warnings) in stderr and all output to stdout.

   To use the sample program in docs :

     $ ./main/epilog < docs/sample
